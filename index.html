                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Welcome to Diptaishik's homepage! Here's a summary of myself ( to be updated gradually ):  </h2>
                    <p class="lead"> “Luxem-what?” “Haha, no no it is this small country to the north of France” “And they have an uni there?” Yeah they had one Uni there where Dip got in. Dip had never been very good at anything, however he really dreamt to be. Yes he dreamt more than doing, this was precisely his problem. Also he had other behavioural problems, quite quirky ones. However, he was a decent guy and had an annoyingly lofty moral code. I thought he used it to protect himself from something, who knows what, but it didn’t correlate with reality. So when he was in high school, he wanted to become a mathematician, quite vocally. I again don’t think he understood why, it was for him a way to be smartest among all, which again shows his stupidity. This dream led him to a bumpy trip across India, year-gaps, failures. To follow his peers, and seemingly out of option (as the labour market doesn’t want expertise in point set topology) he decided phd was the only way out of misery. Somewhere he felt he can do a good phd, which again brings us back to another flaw of this guy: he didn’t know how much is possible by him. Whenever I told him to calm down with aspirations he would say “if you aim for the 10th floor you reach the 5th”, some old Bengali saying. The cycle wasn’t good for him: hope-dream-fail-repeat. Yes, there’s a reason I didn’t mention work in the context. He is also very confident apparently, but trust me his source of confidence is from hope and nothing else. We knew he had a strong religious background and his mom really believed in supernatural existence. In this sense the source of his bravery was cute, he believed in destiny and stuff. So this Dip, found a phd  program in Europe, in Luxembourg. They pay him too apparently, he was ready to go. Was he interested more in Europe than the Ph.D.? Undoubtedly..as a middle class Indian he had only seen those scenes in TV appearing in the daily travel show. Also he had been fascinated with stories of mathematicians huddled up in some alpine cottage discussing motives and schemes.</p>
